                   JAVA SCRIPT

JAVA SCRIPT is most widely used programming language on the web and is used on most websites.
The building blocks of Java script make up every program and line of java script.
Just like a language has nouns,verbs and prepositions,java script has its own building blocks.
Instead of calling them building blocks,however,developers called them data types.
  thank you.
